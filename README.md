SUPER BASIC!!!


Changes the look of Songza.com to be a bit sexier

if you've got feedback, let me know! (nick@mostowich.com)

I've only tested it on my machine on a 1080p monitor. it ain't perfect, the css ain't commented, and it is super hackish. but it (kind of) works!!

To use: download the manifest and CSS file. Put em in a folder. go into chrome extensions, enable dev. load unpacked extension. select that folder. bam. good to go.
