SUPER BASIC!!!


Changes the look of Songza.com to be a bit sexier

if you've got feedback, let me know! (nick@mostowich.com)

I've only tested it on my machine on a 1080p monitor. it ain't perfect, the css ain't commented, and it is super hackish. but it (kind of) works!!

To use: download the manifest and CSS file. Put em in a folder. go into chrome extensions, enable dev. load unpacked extension. select that folder. bam. good to go.

So you want your own background image? WHAT IS MINE NOT GOOD ENOUGH OR SOMETHING?? anyway just change literally the second line of CSS to point to the URL of the image you want instead of my beautiful alberta mountains (if you REALLY want to).
